🏦 Banking Loan Analysis Project Using Python & Power BI

This project focuses on analyzing loan repayment behavior in the banking domain to determine whether customers are likely to pay back loans on time — helping banks make data-driven lending decisions. The analysis combines Python for data cleaning and exploration with Power BI for interactive visualization.

🎯 Objective

To analyze customer loan data, identify repayment patterns, and assess the risk of providing new loans. The goal is to build insights that help financial institutions minimize default risk and improve loan approval strategies.

🧠 Approach

Data Collection: Gathered raw customer and loan data from multiple sources.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and inconsistencies using Pandas and NumPy.

Transformed categorical and numerical variables for better analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Performed trend and correlation analysis to understand factors affecting loan repayment.

Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for visual exploration of key metrics.

Dashboard Creation:

Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize customer repayment behavior, loan approval trends, and defaulter patterns.

📊 Key Insights

Identified customer segments with higher loan default risk.

Analyzed income, credit history, and loan amount as major repayment factors.

Created visual reports showing loan approval rates, repayment percentages, and customer categories.

Enabled data-driven decisions on whether to approve or reject new loan applications.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Power BI: Dashboard design and data visualization

🚀 Outcome

This project provides a comprehensive view of customer loan repayment trends, helping banks evaluate lending risks effectively. By combining Python analytics with Power BI dashboards, it demonstrates a full data analysis workflow — from raw data to strategic insights.

✅ A complete end-to-end banking analytics project integrating data cleaning, EDA, and Power BI visualization for loan risk assessment.
